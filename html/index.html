		<p>Located in Central Paris, and originally built as a fortress in the 12th Century, the Louvre is one of the
			oldest art museums in the rankings, opening its doors in 1793. Not only is the Louvre the largest museum in
			the world, but it is also the world’s most popular too, boasting over 7.3 million visitors in 2016 alone.
			Ranking highest in all five key reputation drivers regarding its collection, the Louvre has over 38,000
			artefacts in eight specific departments, with its most iconic being Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.

			The Louvre tops the rankings for global reputation, with a score of 84.3%, despite placing second within
			Europe, behind the Dutch Van Gogh Museum. It is highly regarded for the quality of its collection,
			contribution to society and its leadership in the museum world, ranking top for all three of those specific
			areas. The Louvre is proof that there is a correlation between the familiarity of a museum and its
			reputation, with 63% of participants being aware of it, ranking it the most well-known art museum.
